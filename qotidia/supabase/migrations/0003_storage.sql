-- Qotidia — private storage buckets.
-- All child media is private by default (brief §4). No public buckets.
-- Print PDFs are shared with the printer only via short-lived signed URLs.

-- Users can only touch objects under their own user id folder.

-- Dropped first so this file can be re-run. The buckets above were already
-- written that way; the policies were not, and they are the part that
-- survives starting over — storage lives in its own schema, so dropping and
-- recreating `public` leaves them behind. Re-running the schema then failed
-- on "policy already exists" after appearing to get all the way through.
